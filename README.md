```tsx
<DataProvider uriByFirstLevelFields={{
  "characters": "https://rickandmortyapi.com/graphql",
  "pokemons": "https://graphql-pokeapi.graphcdn.app",
  "allPlanets": "https://swapi-graphql.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/index"
}}>
    ...
</DataProvider>
```

### Hooks
With Suspense:
```ts
const { data } = useSuspenseDataQuery(gql`
   query NameQuery {
     characters {
       results { id name }
     }
     pokemons {
       results { id name }
     }
   }
   query PlanetQuery {
     allPlanets {
       planets { id name }
     }
   }
`);
```
  
With basic hook:
```ts
const { loading, data, error } = useDataQuery(gql`query { ... }`);
```
